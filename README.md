# filter_trials_by_start_frame

This program sorts c3d files on the condition that they start at zero frames.
It will ask you to save an .xlsx file which contains the files sorted and their directories.

As of right now you need to run this program from the terminal or vscode and you must install the packages: os, pandas, tkinter, and c3d

I plan to package this in an .exe or .bat file for easier if I can't install vscode on the vicon laptop.
