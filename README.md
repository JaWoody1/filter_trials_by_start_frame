# filter_trials_by_start_frame

This program sorts c3d files on the condition that they start at zero frames.
It will ask you to save an .xlsx file which contains the files sorted and their directories.

Steps to install python and run this script:

Download python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Set Python PATH: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX
Set Python Pip PATH: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts

open cmd prompt and navigate to directory of main.py
run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
run 'python main.py'


I plan to package this in an .exe or .bat file for easier use if I can't install vscode on the vicon laptop.
