# filter_trials_by_start_frame

This program sorts c3d files on the condition that they start at zero frames.
It will ask you to save an .xlsx file which contains the files sorted and their directories.

ISSUE: Windows defender is flagging my EXE because it does OS file management. Looking to get that fixed

EXE file has been created so just download the newest release (Build)

OLD: As of right now you need to run this program from the terminal or vscode and you must install the packages: os, pandas, tkinter, openpyxl, xlsxwriter, and c3d

OLD: I plan to package this in an .exe or .bat file for easier use if I can't install vscode on the vicon laptop.
